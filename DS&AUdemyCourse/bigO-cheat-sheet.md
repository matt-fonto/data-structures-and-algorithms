### Big O Cheat Sheet

---

1. We use it to measure the complexity growth of an algorithm
2. Focuses on runtime to perform operations according to input
3. It tells us which algorithm or code is best
4. Allows us to measure scalable code (Speed + Memory)
   - Knowing how to save your company money is great!
5. It describes how to save resources

## Big Os

O(1) Constant - no loops
O(n) Linear - loops (while/for)
O(n^2) Quadratic - nested loops
O(n!) Factorail - add a loop for every element
O
O

## Observations

**Iterating through half a collection is still O(n)
**Two separated collections: O(a + b) || O(a \* b)

## What causes time complexity?

1. Operations (+, -, \*, /)
2. Comparisons (>, <, =)
3. Looping (for, while)
4. Outside function call (function())

## What causes space complexity?

variables
Data structures
Function call
Allocations

## Rule Book

1. Always worst cause
2. Remove constants
3. Different inputs should have different variables.
   - for steps in order
   * for nested steps
4. Drop non-dominant terms
